# PEMDAS-Quiz-v2
This is my second version of PEMDAS Quiz. If you don't know, PEMDAS is the order of operations for math.
P = Parentheses
E = Exponents
M = Multiplication
D = Division
A = Addition
S = Subtraction
------------------------------
This is my first coding/building project so do't judge too much
------------------------------
There are only 5 questions that all have PEMDAS in them

Enjoy!
